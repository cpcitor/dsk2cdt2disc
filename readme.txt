Uses exomizer and 2cdt, many thanks to their respective authors

Usage: dsk2cdt <file.dsk>

you will get side1.cdt, side2.cdt etc depending on the number of sides in the dsk.

Put a blank disc (or one you don't care about) into your CPC, then

run"

The loader will *not* wait or warn you about losing your disc contents!
